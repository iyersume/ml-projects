## Report for Smartcab system

### Implement a Basic Driving Agent

***QUESTION:*** _Observe what you see with the agent's behavior as it takes
random actions. Does the **smartcab** eventually make it to the destination?
Are there any other interesting observations to note?_

As expected, agent takes random actions at each intersections. There are
multiple instances when the action taken is against the signal at the
intersection.


### Inform the Driving Agent


***QUESTION:*** _What states have you identified that are appropriate for modeling the **smartcab** and environment? Why do you believe each of these states to be appropriate for this problem?_

***OPTIONAL:*** _How many states in total exist for the **smartcab** in this environment? Does this number seem reasonable given that the goal of Q-Learning is to learn and make informed decisions about each state? Why or why not?_



### Implement a Q-Learning Driving Agent

***QUESTION:*** _What changes do you notice in the agent's behavior when compared to the basic driving agent when random actions were always taken? Why is this behavior occurring?_



### Improve the Q-Learning Driving Agent
***QUESTION:*** _Report the different values for the parameters tuned in your basic implementation of Q-Learning. For which set of parameters does the agent perform best? How well does the final driving agent perform?_

***QUESTION:*** _Does your agent get close to finding an optimal policy, i.e. reach the destination in the minimum possible time, and not incur any penalties? How would you describe an optimal policy for this problem?_
