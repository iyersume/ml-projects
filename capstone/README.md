Files in project submission:

1. Report:
- .md: contains the source of the report
- .html: HTML export of the report. This is the recommended format to
view the report
- .pdf: PDF export of the report. The pdf export is reasonable except for some
figures that go beyond the right margin. HTML format is recommended for this
reason.

2. Code:
All code and created images are in Bike-sharing.ipynb. This is an ipython
notebook that can be viewed by starting a Jupyter server.

3. Data:
All necessary data is available in hour.csv and is imported in the Jupyter
notebook.
